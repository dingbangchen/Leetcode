# Merge Sort
## General principle

* Breaks down problems into multiple subproblems recursively until they become simple to solve
* solutions are combined to solve original problems
* Time Complexity: O(n*log(n))
  1. split array into half
  2. call Merge Sort on each half to sort them recursively
  3. Merge both sorted halves into one sorted array
